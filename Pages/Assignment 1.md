## Water and the Amsterdam Paralympics
Many requirements are important to include in the Amsterdam Paralympics' organization. Among other things, the event cannot have an impact on commercial water transport and a minimum impact on canal boatsâ€™ routes. In addition, it is crucial to get an idea of the pollution level of the canals. On this page, we will research whether there is sufficient data available to ensure the feasibility of the Amsterdam Paralympics from an environmental and safety perspective.  

## Conclusions
Based on our research, not all canals are consistently monitored, so data available is limited. According to the Water Framework Directive (Rijksoverheid, 2023) report on monitoring surface water from 2020, the water quality is either inadequate or poor in a significant number of the canals, in 2019 [dataset 5: (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2021)]. Further information is required to understand whether safe routes of 5km can be planned for an open swim event which should have no impact on commercial shipping and little impact on the canal traffic overall. A limited set of data also shows that swimming in the canals increases the risk of acute gastrointestinal illness [dataset 2: (Hintaran et al., 2018)].  

Water quality measurements should be taken 48 hours prior to the event, to make sure adequate advice can be given on the health risks taken by the participants. Next to that, the water temperature should be measured in the middle of the course two hours prior to the event to make sure it is sufficient for the event to take place.  

## Useful data
We decided that the following information will be useful to draw-up an advice for the municipality of Amsterdam on the feasibility of the Paralympics from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an environmental perspective: 
* Water quality and ecological conditions - pollution levels  
* Medical data sets - to identify any specific health concerns 

Commercial routes (for all water transport types) 

Weather and Climate Data- historical weather data for Amsterdam in May to assess the climate conditions and potential risks, such as extreme temperatures or storms. 

Sewage system overflow data 

Previous Event Reports- reports and lessons learned from previous open water swimming events in Amsterdam.  

 

According to the Open water swimming guid of Fina (2022), there are a number of factors that need to be considered and documented before an area of open water is used for an event. These factors depend on whether a sea, lake or river swim is being considered.  

Access, condition, sufficient space and proximity of start and finish points  

Likely water temperature (set event minimum and maximum temperature)  

Currents or eddies  

Water quality  

Hidden, overhanging or underwater hazards  

Other water users  

Minimum depth of not less than 1.40 m. at any point, including start and finish  

Conditions underfoot at start and exit  

Sites for medical evacuation along the course
