## Energy and the Amsterdam Paralympics
The water conditions in the canals are important for swimmers of the open water swim of the Amsterdam Paralympics. It is desirable to create ideal conditions for the swimmers and we certainly do not want to expose them to any health risks Therefore, we will research whether the canal- and support boats present during the event might pollute the environment with their diesel engines and what could be done to improve the conditions. We also consider that Amsterdam wants to advertise the event as a Neutral Energy Event.  

*Note*: We take “canal boats/commercial vessels” as daily commercial “passagiersvaart”  what is present every day and “recreational” as not commercial “pleziervaart", this occurs mainly on days with nice weather. 

### Advice
We advise the organization to use 20 support boats during the open water swim of the Amsterdam Paralympics. These boats are only a risk for the water quality if a fuel spill or leak occurs, which is a small chance. The transition to cleaner energy sources for canal boats would have limited direct impact on the water quality in the canals themselves. Thus, it will not contribute to increasing the conditions for the swimmers. However, it can still be considered to shift to electric driven boats. It can contribute to better air quality, reduce noise pollution and help to create a NEE. However, high costs, limited time and other important dificulties must be taken into account. Such as ensuring that the electricity used is generated by renewable energy, carbon offsetting and other sustainable event management strategies.   

### Information
**Canal boats in Amsterdam**  
In Amsterdam the boats can be divided into two categories: commercial canal boats and recreational canal boats. In 2020, there were 550 commercial vessels, and approximately 12.000 recreational ones. Out of these commercial boats, 75% is already electrical. This comes down to 412 boats. When looking at the recreational boats, only 5% is emission free, which is 600 recreational boats (Sterling, 2020). The commercial canal boats are responsible for the vast majority of the canal traffic, so their emissions have a bigger impact on the air quality. 

Much of the transport work over water takes place with deck barges that are moved via a push or tugboat. There are about 20 push and tugboats active in Amsterdam, one of which has a hybrid (diesel-electric) drive (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2020). The municipality also has two completely electric boats for city distribution and waste collection. 

**Peak times for canal boats**  
Most canal boats sail the whole afternoon and evening till 20.00. The busiest days are during the weekend. In the Grachtenmonitor 2022, you can see that saturday stands out, but there is not that much of a difference during the days (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2022).

**Energy use of canal boats vs cars**  
To determine the energy consumption of a canal boat, the energy use of a fuel driven Blue Boat trip is calculated, and estimated on 14,5 kWh for a 75-minute trip (Jacobs, 2015). 

<img src = "Picture1.jpg" alt = "Blue boat">

*Figure 1: The Blue Boat which energy consumption is measured (IAmsterdam, 2023)*

We compare the energy consumption of this commercial canal boat to an average car. 

Electric cars can cover up to 100 kilometres with 15 kWh. The route of the Blue Boat was 7,6 kilometres, which needed 14,5 kWh.  

The energy consumption of a fuel driven car is 10 liters petrol per 100 kilometres. One liter of petrol is about 9 kWh. This means that for 100 kilometres 90 kWh of energy is used. 

| Kilometres | Energy consumption electric car [kWh] | Energy consumption Blue Boat [kWh] | Energy consumption fuel driven car [kWh] 
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 7,6 | 1,14 | 14,5 | 6,84| 
| 100 | 15 | 190,79 | 90 | 

The Blue Boat needs approximately 2 times as much energy as a petrol fueled car. 

Side note to this calculation is that the energy consumption of a boat includes the stopping and manoevring time. 

The main reason why boats will always burn more gas than cars is they run on water. Aerodynamics, wind resistance, waves, and drag affect the fuel consumption of a boat. Basically, a boat needs to use more fuel to cover the same distance a car will cover (Storgaard, 2023). 

**Economic feasibility to make the Amsterdam Paralympics an NEE**  
To make our event possible, a route should be identified which, at a minimum, doesn’t impact the commercial shipping on the canals, and is at a safe distance from the shipping routes. To have a neutral energy event status we need a combination of energy-efficient solutions (enough electric boats and vehicles should be available for support during the event- 20 boats), renewable energy should be available (solar panels and wind turbines), carbon offsetting and sustainable event management strategies should be used to ensure that the event has a net-zero impact regarding energy and emissions. Involving all participants in this strategy could also make it economically feasible.  
If we want to propose structural changes in time for the event, that would probably not be economically feasible. Moving to electric engines requires an extensive investment for both commercial and recreational boats, and the investment in charging infrastructure is also substantial, with marinas having insufficient skills and experience to build this infrastructure by themselves. For commercial boats, it takes about three months to strip out the old diesel engine and install the electric engine and batteries. A typical 23m tourist boat needs about 66 batteries, making the conversion cost around 165,000 to 250,000 euros per boat. Commercial boat companies should recoup their costs in about 12 years, according to the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (Storgaard, 2023) For recreational boats, the costs to moving to electric are also depending on the characteristics of the boat (size,weight,etc.) and even a 70% cheaper environmental vignette didn’t encourage much change to the current diesel/fossil fuel base.  


**Overview of support boats and vehicles for the Paralympics**  
For the event we assume to have around 500 participants. For the Rio de Janeiro paralympic games in 2016 there were 593 participants for the swimming activities, so around 500 participants will be an educated guess. According to the Fédération Internationale de Natation (Fina, 2022) the following facilities/equipment are to be provided in addition to those given for the Start and Finish areas: 

* Suitable boats for the Chief Referee and Referees to be used and directed entirely at the Referee's discretion. (**4 boats**- 2 Chief Referee for Men and Women + 2 other Referees) 
* Transport to take all Turn Judges to their allocated positions and to retrieve them immediately after the last swimmer has passed, or upon the Referee declaring the event complete. (**1 boat**) 
* A suitable boat to allow the TOWSC Commission and VIPs to view the competition. (**1 boat**) 
* Safety boats as required, having regard to the course. (every 500m based on Amsterdam City Swim example – **10 boats**)  
* A suitable lead boat that will maintain a position approximately 50 meters ahead of the leading swimmer. (**1 boat**) 
* Spare boats able to substitute should one in service become inoperable, in particular escort boats. (**2 boats**) 
* A supply boat able to provide food and refreshments to all boat occupants throughout the race. (**1 boat**) 

In total we estimate to need 20 boats for approximately 500 participants. Next to this, there are other vehicles necessary to transport both participants and supporters, for which the municipality would support sustainable means, such as public transport.

**Renewable energy for the Paralympics**  
In this paragraph we will determine how many solar panels or wind turbines will be needed for the Paralympics, considering only green energy can be used.  

Half of the boats needed are there for safety reasons, so the average distance a boat will sail is estimated on 15 kilometres. With 20 boats, the total energy needed is 20 * 15km* 1,9kWh = 570 kWh for one day of the event, including one race.

A wind turbine with the power of 2 or 3 Megawatts can generate 6.500.000 kWh per year, in theory (Gaslicht.com, 2023). This would be 17.808 kWh per day. This would be 30 times more than needed for the 20 boats. 

According to the Verschoor (2022) we would need 654 solar panels of 1 meter by 1,65 meters, to keep up with the demand.  

The disadvantage of the use of solar panels or wind turbines for a one-day event is the dependence on good weather conditions for the production of the energy for that particular day. If the energy can be stored in batteries, the energy can be produced on a different day than the usage of it.  


**Renewable energy accommodations within the city**  
It is interesting to know if it is possible to accommodate the facilities for the renewable energy within the city. 

A wind turbine with a power of 2 Megawatts would have a total height of 100 meters (NOS, 2019). It would not be feasible to install this within the time limit, with the approvals and building time. Next to that, the production of the wind turbine will be far more than the energy demand for the event needed. 

The solar panels would take up 1,65 m2*654 = 1079m2. These solar panels can be taken care of by either putting them on roofs or open space. One solution for this could be putting them on the water, which would make it also possible for the panels to be replaced after the event. One limitation of this would be the availability of solar panels and skills to install this many in this amount of time. 

To conclude, the accomodation of both solar panels and wind turbines is possible in the city, but it is not achievable in such a short time frame.

**Possibilities to improve the water conditions**  
In general, the transition to cleaner energy sources for canal boats would have a limited direct impact on water quality in the canals themselves. However, it can indirectly benefit water quality if it leads to reduced fuel spills and emissions that can enter the water. Fuel spills and leaks from boats can contribute to water pollution. Moreover, because passenger and recreational shipping are together responsible for 7% of nitrogen emissions and 4% of particulate matter emissions. Less diesel/fossil fueled boats could contribute to better air quality and less noise pollution (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2023).
