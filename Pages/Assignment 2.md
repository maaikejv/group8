## Energy and the Amsterdam Paralympics
This assignment...

*Note*: We take “canal boats/commercial vessels” as daily commercial “passagiersvaart”  what is present every day and “recreational” as not commercial “pleziervaart", this occurs mainly on days with nice weather. 

## Conclusions
Based on our research, not all canals are consistently monitored, so data available is limited. According to the Water Framework Directive (KRW) report on monitoring surface water from 2020, the water quality is either inadequate or poor in a significant number of the canals, in 2019 [dataset 5: (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2021)]. Further information is required to understand whether safe routes of 5km can be planned for an open swim event which should have no impact on commercial shipping and little impact on the canal traffic overall. A limited set of data also shows that swimming in the canals increases the risk of acute gastrointestinal illness [dataset 2: (Hintaran et al., 2018)].  

Water quality measurements should be taken 48 hours prior to the event, to make sure adequate advice can be given on the health risks taken by the participants. Next to that, the water temperature should be measured in the middle of the course two hours prior to the event to make sure it is sufficient for the event to take place. 

## Useful data

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
