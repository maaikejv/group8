## Energy and the Amsterdam Paralympics
The water conditions in the canals are important for swimmers of the open water swim of the Amsterdam Paralympics. It is desirable to create ideal conditions for the swimmers and we certainly do not want to expose them to any health risks Therefore, we will research whether the canal- and support boats present during the event might pollute the environment with their diesel engines and what could be done to improve the conditions. We also consider that Amsterdam wants to advertise the event as a Neutral Energy Event.  

*Note*: We take “canal boats/commercial vessels” as daily commercial “passagiersvaart”  what is present every day and “recreational” as not commercial “pleziervaart", this occurs mainly on days with nice weather. 

### Advice
We advise the organization to use 20 support boats during the open water swim of the Amsterdam Paralympics. These boats are only a risk for the water quality if a fuel spill or leak occurs, which is a small chance. The transition to cleaner energy sources for canal boats would have limited direct impact on the water quality in the canals themselves. Thus, it will not contribute to increasing the conditions for the swimmers. However, it can still be considered to shift to electric driven boats. It can contribute to better air quality, reduce noise pollution and help to create a NEE. However, high costs, limited time and other important dificulties must be taken into account. Such as ensuring that the electricity used is generated by renewable energy, carbon offsetting and other sustainable event management strategies.   

### Information
#### Canal boats in Amsterdam
In Amsterdam the boats can be divided into two categories: commercial canal boats and recreational canal boats. In 2020, there were 550 commercial vessels, and approximately 12.000 recreational ones. Out of these commercial boats, 75% is already electrical. This comes down to 412 boats. When looking at the recreational boats, only 5% is emission free, which is 600 recreational boats (Sterling, 2020). The commercial canal boats are responsible for the vast majority of the canal traffic, so their emissions have a bigger impact on the air quality. 

Much of the transport work over water takes place with deck barges that are moved via a push or tugboat. There are about 20 push and tugboats active in Amsterdam, one of which has a hybrid (diesel-electric) drive (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2020). The municipality also has two completely electric boats for city distribution and waste collection. 

#### Peak times for canal boats 
Most canal boats sail the whole afternoon and evening till 20.00. The busiest days are during the weekend. In the Grachtenmonitor 2022, you can see that saturday stands out, but there is not that much of a difference during the days (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2022).
